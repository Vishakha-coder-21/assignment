13. What are the features of TensorFlow? 

Open-Source Platform: TensorFlow is free to use and supported by a large community of developers and researchers.

End-to-End Machine Learning Support: It provides tools for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment.

Flexible Architecture: TensorFlow can run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, making it suitable for small and large-scale projects.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Models can run on desktops, mobile devices, browsers, and cloud platforms.

Model Deployment Tools: Includes TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js for deployment in various environments.

Automatic Differentiation: Provides efficient gradient computation for training deep learning models.

High Scalability: Handles large datasets and complex deep learning architectures efficiently.

14. List a few limitations of TensorFlow. 

Steep Learning Curve: Beginners may find TensorFlow difficult to understand, especially low-level APIs.

Complex Debugging: Debugging TensorFlow models is less intuitive compared to PyTorch.

Verbose Syntax: Code can become long and complicated for simple tasks.

Slower in Certain Cases: Some model training tasks may be slower compared to PyTorch implementations.

Version Compatibility Issues: Upgrading between TensorFlow versions can cause code-breaking changes.

Legacy Static Graph Issues: TensorFlow 1.x used static graphs, which were harder to modify (though improved in TensorFlow 2.x).

Less Ideal for Rapid Research: Researchers often prefer PyTorch for quick experimentation due to its dynamic computation graph.

15. What do you know about supervised and unsupervised machine learning?

Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data, meaning both input and output values are provided.
The main objective is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

Purpose: Prediction and classification.

Common Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.

Applications: Email spam detection, price prediction, fraud detection, image classification.

Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the model tries to identify patterns, structures, or groupings without predefined outputs.

Purpose: Pattern recognition, clustering, dimensionality reduction.

Common Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders.

Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, grouping similar items, data compression.
