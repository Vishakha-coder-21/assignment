2. Presentation: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python

Ans ::

1. Class

A blueprint used to create objects.

Contains data (attributes) and methods (functions).

2. Object

An instance of a class.

Represents real-world entities.

3. Inheritance

One class can acquire properties and methods of another class.

Helps in code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

4. Polymorphism

Same function name can perform different tasks based on context.

Increases flexibility in programming.

5. Encapsulation

Protects data by restricting direct access.

Uses methods to control modification of variables.

6. Abstraction

Shows only essential details and hides complexity.

Focuses on what an object does rather than how.
